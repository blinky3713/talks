# Parse You a JSON String using Parsing Combinators! @ [PureScript Conf 2017](http://lanyrd.com/2017/psconf2017/)

In this talk, we will explore the incredible power of parsing combinators by writing a full JSON string parser in around 50 lines of actual code. You'll learn how function composition and standard abstractions in functional programming let you create declarative code that's type safe, easy to reason about, and easy to test.
